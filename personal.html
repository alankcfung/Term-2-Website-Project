		<h2> Why do I like this game? </h2>
		<p>Clash Royale is game I used to play a lot in my elementary-grade and most of my Grade 8 year. Clash Royale is a really addictive game when you use strategy.
		Although losing can be very disappointing sometimes, you get a really good feeling when you win.
		This game includes the concept of clans, where you can 'donate' or 'trade' cards so you can upgrade
		your cards. When you upgrade your cards, you feel really good and you feel you are going to win.
		This game is very addictive, making this a good game to develop gaming strategies and most importantly,
		to have fun!
